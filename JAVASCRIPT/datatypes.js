/* Problem Statement
In your VS Code practice.js, create these 5 variables with proper data types:

city = "Quthbullapur" (string)

pincode = 500043 (number)

isStudent = false (boolean)

graduationYear = null (null)

nextTopic (leave undefined)

Print each variable, then use typeof on each to see their types. Expected: 5 values + 5 types*/

let city = "india"
let pincode = 500043
let isStudent = false
let graduationYear = null
let nextTopic;

console.log(city);
console.log(typeof city);

console.log(pincode);
console.log(typeof pincode);

console.log(isStudent);
console.log(typeof isStudent);

console.log(graduationYear);
console.log(typeof graduationYear);

console.log(nextTopic);
console.log(typeof nextTopic);
